# autotriage
A triage ticket automation script for Fixt and RepairQ built with Python and web development languages.

This script was used to automate the triage ticket process so the repair technicians at my shop could spend more time doing productive things and less time doing paperwork. This script was made during Assurant's time doing in-store repairs for T-Mobile insurance and showcases Selenium web driver automation for two different websites and could even queue tickets for creation. Some input's are being supplied random data instead of the CLI inputs to showcase the script.

Although the in-store repair program ended, T-Mobile decided to keep Assurant as their 3rd party insurance repair provider in their Cell Phone Repair stores mainly due to the performance our technicians were able to deliver during our brief time in-store. The district I worked for (Central Florida) had the highest ticket counts in the nation every month during our contract and it was due to finding creative ways to increase our productivity like this script.

# TLDR 
This code is no longer updated and is mainly here to use in my portfolio as a showcase of my approach to inefficient work processes.

Use the code however you wish.
